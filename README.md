# "Visit Bath" - A User-Centred Website Design Project

## üìù Project Overview

This project involved the UI/UX design process for a conceptual weekend city break website for Bath. The goal was to move beyond standard travel websites and create advanced, user-focused features that solve real traveller problems.

Using **Pencil**, I created annotated, medium-fidelity wireframes for three distinct features, focusing on clear user flow and interaction design. The entire design process was guided by established usability principles, specifically **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics**, to ensure an intuitive and effective user experience on a desktop platform.

## ‚ú® Advanced Features

### 1. "Veni, Vidi, Vici": The Curated Roman Itinerary Generator

This feature allows users to generate a personalized Roman-themed itinerary based on their preferences. It addresses the user's need for a structured yet customizable travel plan, transforming a simple visit into an immersive historical experience. The flow guides the user through budget selection and detailed activity filtering to produce a tailored schedule.

### 2. "Be Roman": The Anti-Tourist Trap Guide

To enhance user trust and provide genuine value, this feature helps visitors identify and avoid common tourist traps, overcrowded areas, and overpriced spots. By providing curated lists of places to avoid and mistakes to be aware of, the feature empowers users to have a more authentic and enjoyable experience, saving them time and money.

### 3. "Hidden Bath": A Local's Secret Guide

This feature caters to the user's desire for discovery and authenticity by providing a curated guide to lesser-known locations, refined by locals. It includes categories like scenic spots, secret cafes, historical gems, and hidden trails, allowing travelers to explore beyond the typical tourist path and experience the city like a local.

## üß† Design Principles & Process

* **User-Centred Design:** Each feature was conceived to solve a specific user problem‚Äîthe need for a plan, the desire for authenticity, and the joy of discovery.
* **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:** The designs incorporate key heuristics such as "User control and freedom" (customising itineraries), "Recognition rather than recall" (clear options), and "Aesthetic and minimalist design."
* **Interaction & Flow:** The wireframes are annotated to clearly map out the user journey, showing interactions, links between pages, and the logical progression through each feature.
* **Medium-Fidelity Wireframing:** This approach was used to focus on structure, layout, and functionality without the distraction of final visual details, ensuring a solid user experience foundation.
